### Performance Comparison of C4.5 and ID3
Algorithms on Go To College Dataset
Decision tree algorithms serve as effective tools for training classification models, offeringboth accuracy and interpretability. Despite the diverse range of algorithms and methodologies available
for decision tree construction, each with its inherent strengths and weaknesses, our study delves into acomparative analysis between two renowned decision tree algorithms: ID3 and C4.5. Within the context
of predicting student enrollment in college based on specific attributes, we employ these algorithms on adataset tailored to this scenario. While our implementations are ground-up endeavors and may exhibit some
limitations, they facilitate a comprehensive evaluation. The primary goal of both ID3 and C4.5 remains theconstruction of decision trees capable of adeptly categorizing instances by leveraging attribute values. C4.5
introduces innovations such as information gain and pruning, refining the decision tree construction process.In contrast, ID3 relies on entropy and recursive splitting to achieve similar ends. Through assessment of theiraccuracy, our experimentation indicates that both algorithms yield comparable performances. Notably, both
algorithms achieve an approximate accuracy of 90% on test dataset.
